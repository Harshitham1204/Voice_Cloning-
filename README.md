# Voice_Cloning-
*AI-powered voice cloning technology that replicates human voices*

Abstract

The objective of this project is to develop an AI-powered voice cloning system capable of replicating human voices with high fidelity and naturalness. By utilizing advanced machine learning techniques and speech synthesis algorithms, the system can generate lifelike voice outputs from minimal input samples. This technology has potential applications in fields like virtual assistants, entertainment, personalized speech synthesis, and accessibility tools for individuals with speech impairments. The project leverages the VCTK dataset for training and fine-tuning models, ensuring diverse voice replication across different accents and tones.

Description

This project focuses on building an AI-powered voice cloning technology that can accurately mimic human voices. By using cutting-edge deep learning models, we aim to create realistic voice outputs that capture the unique characteristics of individual speakers. The project also explores ethical considerations around voice cloning and its implications in real-world applications.

Dataset

We are using the VCTK dataset, which includes speech data from multiple speakers with various accents. This dataset helps in training our models to replicate diverse voice characteristics.
