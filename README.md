# Voice_Cloning-
AI-powered voice cloning technology that replicates human voices


Description

This project focuses on developing an AI-powered voice cloning technology capable of replicating human voices with high accuracy. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques and speech synthesis models, the goal is to generate realistic voice outputs from limited input data.

Dataset

We are using the VCTK dataset, which includes speech data from multiple speakers with various accents. This dataset helps in training our models to replicate diverse voice characteristics.

Technologies Used

Programming Environment: Google Colab
Languages: Python


Progress

Literature Review: Selected top 5 research papers to guide our methodology.
Code References: Evaluated multiple GitHub repositories and finalized the top 5 for implementation guidance.


Installation Instructions

To be updated once the project is ready for deployment.

Usage

Coming soon: Instructions and code snippets on how to clone a voice using our model.

Contributing

We are currently in the development phase. Contributions will be welcome after the initial prototype is completed.

License

To be decided.
